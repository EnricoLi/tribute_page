        <h2>Timeline</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1968</strong> - <strong>Standard e Luxo:</strong><br />
            With round headlights and small square taillights, the first
            generation of the four-door is launched with a four-cylinder
            (2.5-liter) or six-cylinder (3.8-liter) engine, a three-speed
            gearbox on the steering column and options such as disc brakes and a
            vinyl roof.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1971</strong> - <strong>Gran Luxo:</strong><br />
            The top-of-the-line version was the first to feature a four-speed
            floor-mounted gearbox in the SS sport configuration. The sports
            model had four-door and four- and six-cylinder coupe versions, and
            this was the first to receive the iconic 4.1-liter 250 engine. In
            addition, it had several attractions, such as the first four-speed
            gearbox on the floor, three-spoke steering wheel and sports strips.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1975</strong> - <strong>Comodoro:</strong><br />
            Debuting the classic rear with four round taillights, with rosewood
            accents, a beltline stripe, vinyl midroof (the famous Las Vegas
            roof, in the coupe version) etc., the version replaced the Gran Luxo
            as the top of the line.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1980</strong> - <strong>Diplomata:</strong><br />
            In the renovation in which the Opala debuts with square headlights
            and rectangular lanterns, in addition to the emblematic checkered
            steering wheel, the new top of the line causes frisson by bringing
            hydraulic steering, air conditioning and a curved interior as
            standard.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1988</strong> - <strong>SL, SL/E e SE:</strong><br />
            With the end of the coupe version, the sedan and the Caravan receive
            their new entry-level version, the SL; the intermediary is renamed
            Comodoro SL/E and the main one, Diplomata SE. The headlights acquire
            a trapezoidal shape and, between the Opala's two lanterns, a plastic
            panel is inserted that gives the impression of continuity between
            the two pieces.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1991</strong> - <strong>Ãšltimo facelift:</strong><br />
            A year before it was discontinued, the model underwent a subtle but
            impressive restyling, with black and red taillights, octagonal
            headlights, alloy wheels and a smooth steering wheel; The 6-cylinder
            version now has a five-speed gearbox.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1992</strong> - <strong>Collectors:</strong><br />
            Even before saying goodbye, Opala won a farewell edition, with 100
            units manufactured, in blue, black and red. It came with a leather
            folder containing a letter of introduction, a magazine and a VHS
            tape telling the story of the model, in addition to a pen and
            stylized key chains.
